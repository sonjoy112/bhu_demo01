                        <p>In April 1911, Annie Besant met Malaviya and they decided to work for a common Hindu

                            <p> Besant and fellow trustees of the Central Hindu College, which she had founded in 1898, also agreed to
                                 the Government of India's precondition that the college become a part of the new university. Thus Banaras 
                                 Hindu University (BHU) was established in 1916, through a parliamentary legislation, the 'Banaras Hindu University A
                                 ct of 1915', and today it remains a prominent institution of learning in India.[3][33] In 1939, he left the
                                  vice-chancellorship of BHU and was succeeded by S. Radhakrishnan, who later became the president of India.[34]

                                Spread over 16.5 km2 (4,100 acres) with a student population of about 30,000, BHU is the largest

                                Malaviya' son Pandit Govind Malaviya served as the vice-chancellor of BHU from 1948 to 1951. His grandson Justice
                                 Giridhar Malaviya was the chancellor of BHU from 2018 to 2024, till his demise.</p>
